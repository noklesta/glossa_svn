** Introduction

A Glossa installation consists of four elements:
- external programs and libraries: (CWB, Text::NSP, etc)
- cgiRoot: a directory for the cgi programs
- htmlRoot: a directory for the php, javascript and image files
- dataRoot: a "data directory" for configuration files, files stored by
  the users and various miscellaneous files

In addition, Glossa comes with some utility programs to 
encode corpora etc. But these are not strictly necessary.

** Install external programs and libraries

* CWB

1) Install CWB package.
ftp://ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/outgoing/cwb-beta/index.html

2) Install the perl modules that come with the CWB package (listed under 
"contributed software" on the CWB webpage).

3) Copy extern/pm/Query_dev.pm to the directory where the Query.pm CWB module 
is found.

There are some other files in the "extern" directory. These are only
necessary if you run into trouble with the next step (Text::NSP).

* Text::NSP

The latest version of Text::NSP requires Perl 5.8.5, but Glossa comes with 
patched versions of necessary files that can be used with Perl 5.8.0. Thus, 
if you get the following message:
"Perl v5.8.5 required--this is only v5.8.0, stopped at Makefile.PL line 1.",
try using the patched versions instead. They are found under $GLOSSADIR/extern.
If you still experience problems, contact the Text Laboratory at 
tekstlab-post@iln.uio.no.

* Misc modules

DBI
Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
GD::Graph

You may need to install the packages GD and GDTextUtil to satisfy GD::Graph 
dependencies.
 
* MySQL

This is probably installed on your system. If not, refer to www.mysql.com.

You can also use a mysql installation on another machine; this is specified 
during configuration.


** Install Glossa

* cgi programs

Copy the files in $GLOSSADIR/cgi-bin to a cgi-enabled folder. For example:

sudo cp -R $GLOSSADIR/cgi-bin/glossa/ $HTTPDIR/cgi-bin/

Remember that these files need to be executable. 

If you want the cgi-programs to access perl modules outside the default 
system directories, you must edit the "use lib"-line at the start of each 
program. This is useful if you don't have access to a root account.


* Html and Javascript

sudo cp -R $GLOSSADIR/html/glossa $HTTPDIR/htdocs/

In the file html/glossa_text.inc, change the value to the directory of 
your data and configuration files:

  <input name="query_root" type="hidden" value="/var/www/glossa/conf/"></input>

Also, change the values of $cgiRoot and $htmlRoot in index.php and 
stats.php as well as cgiRoot in conf.js-files.

* Data and configuration files

Configuration files need to be kept in a directory that the httpd user has 
access to, but it does not need to be accessible via http (i.e. not in the 
directories from which the http server will display files to the public).

The configuration file directory should contain two subdirectories, "hits"
and "subcorp", which need to be writable by the httpd user.

* CWB files

The directories "reg" and "cwb_dat" must also be accesible by the http user. 
If you already have directories for CWB registry and CWB data, these files 
should probably go there. But the CWB registry used by Glossa for each corpus 
is specified in the configuration files, and the directory for CWB data is 
specified in the CWB registry file (this must be edited to point to the 
appropriate directory).  

The database must be created, named, for instance "glossa". You can then run 
the 

** Minimal configuration

There are many ways to change Glossa by changing configuration files. The 
minimum, however, to get the test corpus running is:

- change the htmlRoot and cgiRoot variables in html/index.php
- change the htmlRoot and cgiRoot variables in js/test.conf.js
- create the a cgi.conf file. The following entries should be included and
  adjusted to your setup:

 # username, password and database name for the database
 db_pwd = 
 db_name = 
 db_uname = 
 db_host = 

 # urls
 htmlRoot = http://www.example.org/glossa/
 cgiRoot = http://www.example.org/cgi-bin/glossa/
 download_url = http://www.example.org/glossa/download/

 # various directories
 logfile = /tmp/glossalog
 cwb_registry = /var/www/htdocs/glossa/reg/
 tmp_dir = /tmp/
 dat_files = /var/www/htdocs/glossa/download/
 config_dir = /var/www/htdocs/glossa/conf/
 subcorp_files = /var/www/htdocs/glossa/conf/test/subcorp/
 hits_files = /var/www/htdocs/glossa/conf/test/hits/

The configuration options are described in the 'Glossa administrators manual'.


** Test installation:

http://www.example.org/glossa/html/index.php?corpus=test


** If the interface does not work

- check that you are using a "safe" browser (Netscape > 7.2, Konqueror and 
some other browsers may create problems).

- check that you can query the test corpus using the cqp command line tool

- check the log file

- try adding "&debug=yes" to the url to index.php
