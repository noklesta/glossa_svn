TODO:
----
[+] IE6 with no DTD, vertical doesn't work (I think this is fixed in latest version)
[+] parent with child elements open stays highlighted in IE50 after leaving parent

[+] when swap images by toggling hidden, we loose the object (maybe better just to toggle src?)
[+] document the many nested tags used to create a menu element
[+] instead of innerHTML for mozilla use the documentFragment
[+] think about rescheduling a close which was already pending
[+] try to combine activate and activeSubMenu
[+] konqueror has incorrect width for submenu table (or div)
[+] preference for no delay in top menu activate/deactivate once active
[+] try to get rid of objects stored in the elements

    domMenu_verticalExpand = 'north|south'
    domMenu_horizontalExpand = 'east|west'
[@] handle vertical menu
[@] click on top level should close children if already open
[@] if a submenu is still closing from an old active path and we hit the top level...that menu delays closing where all the rest close immediately...
[@] in the changeActivePath function, clear a timeout for the same event if it exists at the bottom of the function (we don't want to schedule the close twice)

[@] pass in info on the event from the function
[@] sibling of parent to child...handle highlight of parent
[@] domMenu callTimeout will just ignore if -1
[@] perhaps we can determine if the menu is active based on domMenu_activeElement...for the top level, we won't set activeElement until the child appears
[@] take out the logic from closeEvent when we know we are staying in the menu and let domMenu_closeActivePath() do the work
[@] preference for mousing over element in active path, do we keep path like KDE
[@] active element routine is messy
[@] if go to parent and leave open the child menu of child, then going to sibling leaves open that child menu
[@] if go to parent element, and currentTarget had children open...leave them open

[@] when hide a select, assign the reason attribute, then when we unhide them, find ones with only the reason of the current id set
[@] how about highlight top level when flyover, but delay submenu creation?
[@] when mouseout of element on one level and mouseover another level, keep menu open
[@] each element should have a hash of its children, so that we can access them
[@] kill submenu create timeout when move away from parent !important
[@] create delay on child element?

[@] fix NoOffFirstLineMenus to NumTopLevelMenus
[@] fix window.status to work for menu items
[@] remember status get rid of this

NOTES:
-----
remember, you can style each submenu using the ids of the elements
when reusing a DOM object that was created, you must clone it to make adjustments to it (seems like a bug), for now I just hide it, probably better anyway
- if necessary, remember to make use of relatedTarget when deciding whether to close a menu item instead of the settimeout when go over the text of an menu
