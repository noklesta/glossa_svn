[+] Mozilla is blinking the element in the upper left corner during create,
    before positioning it

[+] Two menus at the same time doesn't work in IE Mac (who cares?)

[+] Mostly just display and positioning bugs.  The functionality of the menu is
    definitely close to 100%.  It is certainly less buggy than the mozilla menu and
    the windows toolkit menu.  Turns out KDE actually has one of the least buggiest
    menu systems.
